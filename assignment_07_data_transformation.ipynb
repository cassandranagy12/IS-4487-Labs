        "In this assignment, you will:\n",
        "- Load the Airbnb dataset you cleaned in Assignment 6\n",
        "- Apply data transformation techniques like scaling, binning, encoding, and feature creation\n",
        "- Make the dataset easier to use for tasks like pricing analysis, guest segmentation, or listing recommendations\n",
        "- Practice writing up your analysis clearly so a business audience — like a host, marketing manager, or city partner — could understand it\n",

        "## Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Airbnb analysts, hosts, and city partners rely on clean and well-structured data to make smart decisions. Whether they’re adjusting prices, identifying high-performing listings, or designing better guest experiences, they need data that’s transformed, organized, and ready for use.\n",
        "\n",

While the one-hot encoding isn't neciesarily helpful in condensing the data system it allows for the categorical data to be put in a format that is useable."

        "3. If I was goint ot build a tool I would prepare the data further for a specific task. I would make sure all the data in that specific task was transformed using tools like scaling, encoding categorical data, etc.\n",
        "4. The data transformation techniques used in this assignment closely align with both of my learning outcomes. They show how data transformation techniques like scaling, binning, and creating ratio variables can be applied to optimize supply chain sustainability and structure data for solving real-world sustainability challenges."
